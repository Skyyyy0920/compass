# To remove liked songs from the Spotify queue, I need to:
# 1. Get the list of liked songs (using show_liked_songs).
# 2. Get the current queue (let's check if there is an API for that).
# 3. Remove any liked songs from the queue (let's check if there is an API for removing songs from the queue).
# 4. Start the player (let's check for a player control API).
# Let's first check for queue and player control APIs in the spotify app.
